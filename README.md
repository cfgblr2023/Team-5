# Team-5
Problem Statement:-
A platform which can be used for coordinating between mentors, mentees and the admin with a focus on cost-effective strategies and basic technology utilization.
Solution:-
We have developed a website for allotting the mentors to the volunteered female mentees using django framework as a backend and sqlite as our database so that the admin, mentor and mentee have access to this site.
Admin gets to see the overall working and gets to add,update and delete the details of the mentor and mentee so the admin allots the content of the courses to be taught and the mentor can then uplaod any of his materials or videos, so based on the same laguage spoken by the mentor and mentee ,the allocation of mentors to mentee is done.
Thus, its a platform which can be used for coordinating between mentors, mentees and the admin with a focus on cost-effective strategies and basic technology utilization.
